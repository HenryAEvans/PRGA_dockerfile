# Setup
1. Build the docker container with `./build.sh`  
2. Run the docker container with `./run.sh`  
You should now be in the docker container. To use PRGA you should source the activate file at `/root/prga/envscr/activate`. After this, try opening a python shell and running `import prga`. If this works, you have succesfully built PRGA.  

More docs to come as I myself figure out what the heck I'm doing.
